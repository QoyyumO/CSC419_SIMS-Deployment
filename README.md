# SIMS & E-learning Project

## Branch Naming Strategy
Feature branches: feature/dev_inititals/task_id
Bugfix branches: bugfix/dev_inititals/task_id

## Repo conventions
- Branches: `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`
- Work flow: Task → branch → PR → Review → Merge
- All PRs must:
  - Link to a task (`Closes #`)
  - Be approved by the Project Manager
- See `docs/team_roles.md` for responsibilities.
